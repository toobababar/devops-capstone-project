**As a** developer
**I need** to set up development environment
**So that** I can begin developing the microservices.
      
### Details and Assumptions
    * The development environment will include necessary tools such as Python and a database.
    * The environment should support both local development and testing.
    * Database configuration should be done using environment variables or configuration files.   
### Acceptance Criteria     
    gherkin 
    Given I have an IDE
    When I setup my enviropnment
    Then I can begin building

**As a** user
**I need** to read the details of a specific account from the service
**So that** I can view the account informations.
      
### Details and Assumptions
    * The account will be retrieved by its unique identifier (account ID).
    * The service will respond with the account's details such as account holder's name or ID.
    * The service will return a 404 status code if the account does not exist.   
### Acceptance Criteria     
    gherkin 
    Given user calls an account
    When service receives call
    Then account is retrieved if available or sends back 404 error.

**As a** user
**I need** to update the details of a specific account from the service
**So that** I can modify the account informations.
      
### Details and Assumptions
    * Account details such as the account holder's name canm be updated.
    * The service will accept a PUT request to update account details.
    * The service will return a 404 error if the account does not exist.
### Acceptance Criteria     
    gherkin 
    Given user changes data on account
    When service receives update
    Then account will be updated.

**As a** user
**I need** to delete an account from the service
**So that** I can remove the account informations.
      
### Details and Assumptions
    * The service will support the deletion of accounts via a DELETE request.
    * Assumed that account deletion is permanent (no soft delete).
    * The service will return a 404 status code if the account to be deleted does not exist.
### Acceptance Criteria     
    gherkin 
    Given user wants to delete an account
    When service receives request to delete
    Then account will be deleted.

**As a** user
**I need** list all accounts in the banking service
**So that** I can view all available accounts
      
### Details and Assumptions
    * The service will return a list of all accounts in the system.
    * The response should include the account ID, account number, account holder name, and balance.
    * Pagination should be implemented if there are many accounts.
    * The service will return a 200 status code and the list of accounts.
### Acceptance Criteria     
    gherkin 
    Given user wants to lists accounts
    When service receives request to serve account names
    Then service returns a 200 OK response with the account list.

**As a** developer
**I need** containerize the banking account microservice using Docker,
**So that** I can run the service in isolated, reproducible environments
      
### Details and Assumptions
    * The service will be containerized using a Dockerfile that includes all necessary dependencies.
    * Assumed that the microservice is already functional and can be executed from within the container.
    * Docker images will be built and stored locally or in a registry.
### Acceptance Criteria
    gherkin 
    Given the request to create a docker container
    When Docker container builds successfully and includes all necessary dependencies
    Then microservice runs successfully within the Docker container.

**As a** devops engineer
**I need** deploy the Docker image of the banking account service to a Kubernetes cluster,
**So that** the service is available in a production-like environment
      
### Details and Assumptions
    * The Docker image from the previous user story will be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using a deployment YAML file.
    * Assumed that a Kubernetes cluster is set up and accessible.
    * The service will be exposed via a LoadBalancer or NodePort for external access.
### Acceptance Criteria
    gherkin 
    Given The Docker image is successfully pushed to a container registry
    When A Kubernetes deployment YAML file is created and deployed to the Kubernetes cluster
    Then The service is accessible via an exposed IP or domain name.
